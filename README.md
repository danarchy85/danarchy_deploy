# DanarchyDeploy

dAnarchy Deploy is a template-driven Ruby gem to deploy locally or remotely to Gentoo systems (and debian/ubuntu, more being added). This can take a .JSON or .YAML input file, or a CouchDB connection as a deployment template and install necessary packages, add users and groups, write ERB templates, and decompress tar/zip archives. More documentation incoming.
